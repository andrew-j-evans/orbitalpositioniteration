# Read Me for orbitalpositioniteration
orbitalpositioniteration takes a semimajor axis and eccentricity value, and will then calculate the initial position of the orbit. Afterwards, it will iterate through position, velocity, and specific mechanical energy to create graphs of the three respective to time, and plot the three. It also creates a 2D array that keeps track of the position in PQW coordinates, and will plot it on a 3D plot. 
## Status
### [Unreleased]
## Creator: A.Evans
### Created: 2023.30.03
## Last Editor: A. Evans

## How to Use
- Download the [orbitalpositioniteration.zip] folder and extract its contents to your computer
- Open the orbitalpositioniteration folder and open the file called orbitalpositioniteration.m
- Change the values for a (semimajor axis) and e (eccentricity) and see how different orbits are created
